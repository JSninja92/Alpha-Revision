### COMPUTER PROGRAMMING: The process of designing and writing instructions that computers can execute to perform specific tasks or solve problems.

### PROGRAM: A sequence of instructions that performs a specific task or a series of tasks when executed by a computer
- Program has data and algorithms.

### DATA: The raw information that algorithms analyze and process.
### ALGORITHM: A sequence of steps that define how data is to be analyzed and processed.

### JAVASCRIPT: JavaScript is a scripting language that allows you to make web pages interactive. It is commonly used to manipulate the content of web pages, respond to user actions, and communicate with servers. It runs in web browsers, making it a crucial part of front-end web development. create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images.

### HTML: the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.

### CSS: language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.

### NODE JS: JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is designed to build scalable network applications and is commonly used for server-side development. It's an engine that executes the JavaScript you write. It's a source code editor.

### VS Code: It's a program that executes the JavaScript that you write, It's a source code editor. 

### VARIABLES: variables are used to store and manipulate data. 

### DATA TYPES: 
- Number: covers both integers (whole number) and floats(real number).
- Boolean: true or false.
- String: grouping of characters.
- Undefined: the value of the variable has not been assigned yet.
- Null: the variable has been assigned a null value.

### Primitive: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol.
- Primitive data types are immutable; their values cannot be changed. When you assign a new value to a variable of a primitive type, you are actually creating a new value.
### Complex/Reference: Objects, Arrays, Functions.
- Reference data types, often referred to as complex data types, involve variables that store references or addresses to the actual data rather than directly storing the data itself.

### Loops
- Executing block of code repeatedly until certain condition is met.

### Arrays
- JavaScript arrays are dynamic, meaning you can change their size by adding or removing elements.
